# Scarlet/Violet Pokedex Project

## Purpose

This project was created for me to learn react and how to implement an express backend with react.  
The idea of the project is a web app that you can track the pokemon from the scarlet and violet  
games that you have caught and have yet to catch.  
  
## Technologies used

- Node an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.  
- Express a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications.  
- React a js library that builds user interfaces by combining sections of code (components) into full websites.  
- Axios a promised-based HTTP client for JavaScript.  
- mysql a relational database management system developed by Oracle that is based on structured query language.  
- Passport a popular, modular authentication middleware for Node.js applications.

## Functionalities

- The core of the web app is a table with images, id numbers, names, locations, type, and caught status of each pokemon in scarlet/violet
- A search bar to find a single row in the table based on the pokemon name
- A sorting feature to sort based on type of pokemon
- A checkbox to track if a pokemon has been caught yet, the status of the checkbox persists for each user
- A sorting feature to sort based on if a pokemon has been caught or not
- Registration functionality to save new user info to the database
- Login functionality to have each users caught info persist in the database under their userID
